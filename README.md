Created a JS program to simulate the dice game known as the Pig Game.

To play:
Player 1 starts, they can roll until they get a 1, updating their current score, and they can choose to 'bank it' to their global score, or until they get a 1, thus it will be player 2s turn. Switching back and forth until one player has their global score reach 100.
